"I really wish people would read. The vaccine isn’t a cure, it is a immune booster. Meaning it still spreads the same but people who are vaccinated will have little to no reaction to the virus. So, no, it’s not weird to get covid from someone who is fully vaccinated."

"@whozenexxt @LaTrioli It is, particularly because it has given the public in those states a false sense of security. Proven everyday by the lacklustre vaccine rates in QLD and WA.

"@zephyr9673 @Mike_Honey_ @covidliveau Vaccines dramatically lower infections and then further reduce onward transmission. They aren't 100% but they have a big effect.

@AdamDopamine @ScottAdamsSays Hey @ScottAdamsSays  have you tried applying this logic to the vaccine trials?  https://t.co/kVM3n4s81d
"So my son’s risk of being hospitalized due to COVID is around 5 (rounding up to be conservative) in a million but his risk of suffering from vaccine induced myocarditis is somewhere between 56 and 69 in a million. Again, what am I missing?!"

"@jaekwon @michaelharriot Thimerosal exposure is about as junk an argument as you claim the ""autism"" link is. The concerns over thimerosal were completely unfounded, yet it was taken out to appease the antivaxxers at the risk of vaccines expiring more quickly."
"THAT'S THE STUFF! 334,832* vaccine doses reported across Australia today. By state:  ACT: 12,046 NSW: 121,170 NT: 2,445 QLD: 46,359 SA: 16,904 TAS: 6,345 (daily record!)

I got less symptoms the third time around for the vaccine with this booster shot. I was sleepy AF though
@JonGordon11 @Cernovich I had a decent case of covid AND a vaccine shot and I'm still considered a leper here in Canada until I'm double vaxxed. Vaccine certificates appear to be on the way so double vaccinated will likely be the only option until of course triple vaccinated becomes the norm
"@JulianHillMP When we first had covid19 outbreaks, Australia had the gold standard and third world countries were struggling. We still have it over the US. Even proportionally, we're doing better. Thus why we didn't need 50,000,000 vaccines (2 shots) for a long time"
@PrecisExMac @AustinSwain12 @iluvsesamest @thikkremlindoor @usadid911 @tinnkky The vaccine (phizer) has already been approved by the fda. It’s not an experiment or a ghost to spook you.
@PAB_ROFL_World And for me we have the vaccine passport.

@RinaRivera6 @Bishopoftyler Your vaccine protects you. It doesn’t prevent transmission. It has nothing to do with the common good.

PSA: We didn't wait until there was an outbreak to get excited about vaccines. They were always due to ramp up this time of year. The outbreak has coincided with that by chance. Vaccinations have been ramped up further accordingly. Judith is spinning for clicks.

@talkRADIO Out of the exact article!!!!  They are considered extremely rare - there have been 332 reported cases and 58 reported deaths - after nearly 35 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK.
Mandating vaccines is one thing but figuring out who will pay for employee testing is another. Glad that @BuffyWicks will be returning to the drawing board to make sure further conversation continues. 👍🏾
